I based my generated city off of the fictional city of Midgar from the game Final Fantasy 7. I changed the generated city by varying the sizes of each of the buildings and making everything more green tinted. I also added a dark green skybox, the same one I used for lab 5 which can be found in this same github repository under lab5. Finally, I made one building in the center very large to represent the Shinra Tower from the game and some medium sized buildings to represent the Mako Reactors with accompanying spotlights.
