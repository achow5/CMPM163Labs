Answers to 24: 

uv formula:
a. 
given the width of the grid:
The conversion formula is x = (width-1)u 
i.e. in this grid x = 7u

b. 
given the height of the grid:
The conversion formula is y = (height - 1) - (height - 1)v 
i.e. in this grid y = 7 - 7v

c. The color would be white due to rounding the coordinates up to get the nearest approximation.

Cubes: 

Middle Cube: Basic cube with a texture and normal map 

Leftmost Cube: Basic cube with a texture and no normal map (a copy of the first w/o a normal map)

Bottom Cube: Another cube with a normal map and mismatched texture.

Right Cube: A cube created using a shader and uniform to get a texture (but no lighting).

Top Right Cube: A cube created and tiled by modifying the vUv variable in the fragmentShader and using fract
