Description: I created my lab by following the shader tutorial and water effect creation tutorials provided in the handout. 
After creating the initial rough sphere from the tutorial, I made several copies of the sphere and changed their sizes and rotations
in order to create a mountain range and terrain. I resized the flowing water to create a river, and created another flowing plane
to use as a waterfall. Afterwards I added several cubes, spheres, and cylinders to symbolize other objects in the environment and 
added a particle system at the bottom of the waterfall to act as splashing bits of water.

Yash also did part 1 of the lab. For the creative portion of their lab they added colors to just about everything in the scene and added a skybox as well. I think that the colors worked really well to bring the scene to life. On the water they messed around with the shader graph to create a texture on the water using voronoi noise. Yash used the Universal Render Pipeline, while I used HDRP; this has gotten me interested in seeing what the differences between the two are.

We did not work together on any parts of the lab.
