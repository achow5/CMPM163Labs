Description: I created my lab by following the shader tutorial and water effect creation tutorials provided in the handout. 
After creating the initial rough sphere from the tutorial, I made several copies of the sphere and changed their sizes and rotations
in order to create a mountain range and terrain. I resized the flowing water to create a river, and created another flowing plane
to use as a waterfall. Afterwards I added several cubes, spheres, and cylinders to symbolize other objects in the environment and 
added a particle system at the bottom of the waterfall to act as splashing bits of water.
